title: Adventures in node.js
postdate: 16 October 2012

During this past summer, my company decided to switch all new development over
to the growing <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> platform for 
server-side JavaScript. Being part of the team that decided this, I had to
personally evaluate it. I started a number of projects, one which I will
showcase for you today.
<br><br>
<a href="http://github.com/samt/node-chat">node-chat</a> is a simple chat app
that consists of a chat server and a web server built in. It allows the client
to view a webpage (with the chat room log) and send messages back and forth. It
was inspired by IRC, but does not support things like multiple channels or
services (although I would like to make an IRC to WebSocket gateway..). Click
on the live demo below to see it work for yourself.
