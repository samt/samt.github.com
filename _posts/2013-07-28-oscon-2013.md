I got 26 t-shirts at OSCON this year. It was a very impressive year, can't say
I've ever come close to that before. In any case, that's not the <i>only</i>
why I attend this convention; the networking opportunities are fantastic, and I
was able to reconnect with some old friends.

I helped out <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a> again this year, which
is always fun. We shared a booth with Bluehost, who are pretty cool guys; they
let us have a corner in their platinum-sponsor booth right in front.

A short trip, but a good one. I wanted to do the expo hall on day 2, but I had
other obligations. In any case, I look forward to attending OSCON again in
2014.
