title: Reflections on Teaching HTML5+JavaScript

My six-week crash course on HTML5 and JavaScript has just come to a close, and
I have to say, there was some crashing involved. As apart of
<a href="hackerlab.org">Hacker Lab</a>'s university they're starting, I created
content, taught HTML5 and JavaScript to 40-30 students who met twice a week for
six weeks. It was an incredible experience and I can tell many students left
with a working knowledge of these technologies they did not have before. I do
have some critiques for myself and my fellow colleges who helped make this a
reality:

<h4>What we did right</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Projects</strong> &mdash; Many lessons were quick lectures
		followed by a project of some sort. This helped students with exposure
		and was largely the favorite activity of many of them. It kept students 
		engaged as well as interested.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Marketing</strong> &mdash; Although not the best marketing in
		the world, we did manage to get many of people interested at the very
		least. We can improve on it, but overall it did the job.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Openness</strong> &mdash; We didn't put any restrictions on who
		can be in the class. We had gentlemen as old as 60 taking the course
		along side 15-year-olds. While this creates a sense of cognitive
		dissonance, it really set the tone to how these classes should be laid
		out: If you're interested and willing, sign up
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>What we did wrong</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Original Curriculum</strong> &mdash; There is so much Open
		Courseware for free that has been tried and tested. Instead, we opted
		to do our own; this was a mistake. Although the information was
		accurate, it was kind of fragmented and seemed contrived in a few ways.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>No Class Size Limit</strong> &mdash; We started with 40 
		students on day one, which caused issues with physical space. There
		should have been a hard cap on the number of people who can take the
		class. It would have saved hours of headache and time.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>No External Materials</strong> &mdash; Students received all
		information from lecture and nothing from reading. While some just
		get it by listening alone, it alienates those who have a harder	time
		grasping it without some material in front of them.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>HTML basics were too quick</strong> &mdash; We went through
		HTML basics quickly, but we had more students not know anything about
		HTML prior to this class than we originally thought. They were having 
		trouble with very basic concepts, ever later on in the course.
	</li>
</ul>

Overall, however, I believe it was a success and I will do another class again.
We will be restructuring it such that the HTML and JavaScript are two separate
classes and we're going to be finding some open courseware of some sort to use
and simply improve upon it.
