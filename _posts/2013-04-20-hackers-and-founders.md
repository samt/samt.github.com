title: Hackers and Founders
postdate: 20 april 2013

The coworking place I inhabit puts on the Hackers and Founders event for
Sacramento where "founders" come to talk to "hackers" about their startup ideas
at a hamburger joint down the street. Partially out of boredom and the desire
for some free food, I attended.
<br><br>
The first thing I ran across was the apparent lack of original ideas in that
every startup proposed was based upon taking a service like Facebook and
rebuilding it for a certain niche market. It reminded me of one of my favorite
comics from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com">The Oatmeal</a>:

<br><br>
Prior to my involvement with Hacker Lab, I can't say I've had to deal with
people such as this often. While I knew people like that existed, I didn't know
they would be so blatant about it, e.g. I had someone literally tell me, "I
wanted to make Facebook but for this market". After sitting through three hours
of  these contrived elevator pitches, I was handed my food bill (thus
eliminating half the reason why I went to begin with).
<br><br>
While this experience wasn't at all surprising to me, it did allow me to
realize exactly why a high number of startups fail. Individuals who do not know
the market and have no connection to the real problem produce unoriginal 
"solutions" that just cause more problems than they solve. If you have an idea,
just keep in mind that <strong>successful products are ones that solve the real
problem</strong> and are not made for the sake of making a multi-billion dollar
organization based upon a knock-off of an already successful predecessor.
