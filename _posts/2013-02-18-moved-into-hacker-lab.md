My company moved into a coworking space called
<a href="http://hackerlab.org">Hacker Lab</a> which features coworking and a
Makerspace with tools and machines. It is a step up in terms of our previous
location... a small office in Davis CA. Now I wont have to commute out there
anymore.

The location is great, I love being within walking distance of everything. In
addition, it seems like a great way to connect to Sacramento's hidden tech
community.
