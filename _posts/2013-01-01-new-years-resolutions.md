title: New Year's Resolutions
postdate: 1 january 2013

The new year can be a time of reflection, but more often, it's a time of
drinking and mindless partying. It's just another day to me in the long-run
so I don't typically give it special treatment. Today, however, is different,
and for no particular reason. I am going to make some New Year's Resolutions.
<br><br>
When I don't take on anything new, I find myself stagnating as a developer.
It's an awful feeling, but easy to overcome. I selected some things I would
like to do by 31 December 2013 as things I've always dismissed and put-off. 

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Proficiency in Android</strong> &mdash; I have only dabbled 
		and tinkered, but I want to get better at it to at least feel 
		comfortable.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Write a book (or be in the process of)</strong> &mdash; This is
		always something I've personally wanted to do. Being a tutor has given
		me a passion for quality instruction and helping students help
		themselves. I want to write a tech book of some sort.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>More Open Source</strong> &mdash; Perhaps the thing I miss the
		most was being actively involved with Open Source. I loved the
		communities, talking at conventions, meetups, and other activities.
	</li>
</ul>
